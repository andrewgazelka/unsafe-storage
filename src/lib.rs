/// [UnsafeStorage] is used to mark that there are some arbitrary invariants

/// "undefined"â€”or at least undocumented, because invariants are expected to be
/// upheld.

/// This is useful in macros which do not encapsulate their storage in modules.
/// This makes the macros for the end-user more ergonomic, as they can use the
